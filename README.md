#A touchscreen ATM for DeVault

**tl;dr**
kivy framework based touchscreen DeVault crypto ATM :atm: for the raspberry pi with a
coin acceptor.


I saw @21isenough 's [LightningATM prototyope](https://github.com/21isenough/LightningATM) on reddit, took a look at the code and got inspired  to learn python. I watched some youtube tutorials
on basic python and started. I didn't have a Raspberry Pi so I got a
usb converter and made a console based [first version](https://github.com/pppest/devault-atm).  

This is the first version of the kivy based ATM. I have plans to extend its functionality and to make different versions.
Here is an image of the DeVault piÃ±ata ATM.

Big shout-out to @21isenough, the Python and Kivy community for sharing so much great information!!!
And to the DeVault devs @jonspock and @proteanx for helping me learn.  
:beers:


**How to use**  
After cloning the repo you will need to download the [DeLight](https://github.com/devaultcrypto/DeLight/releases) client to the atm dir and name the client dir DeLight:
> devault-atm-touch/DeLight/delight

_Note to self: add check for client to code!_

Then install the requirements and run app.py
