# A touchscreen ATM for DeVault

**tl;dr**
kivy framework based touchscreen DeVault crypto ATM for the raspberry pi with a
coin acceptor.

**About**  
I work for the DeVault community and saw @21isenough 's [LightningATM prototyope](https://github.com/21isenough/LightningATM) on reddit, took a look at the code and got inspired  to learn python. Then I watched some youtube tutorials, I can recommend @CoreyMSchafer s [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g),
on basic python and started. I didn't have a Raspberry Pi so I got a
usb converter and made a console based [first version](https://github.com/pppest/devault-atm).  

This is the first version of the kivy based ATM, but I have plans to extend its functionality and to make different versions.
Here is an image of the DeVault piÃ±ata ATM that I am working on:

Big shout-out to @21isenough , the Python and Kivy community for sharing so much great information!!!  
And to the DeVault devs @jonspock and @proteanx for helping me learn.  
:beers:

If you have any questions then come find me in the DeVault [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/JnRZ7BB) or [forum](https://devaultchat.cc/) or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pestdesmadre).

**How to use**  
Take a look at [@21isenough](https://github.com/21isenough/LightningATM)s or [@talenpierre](https://github.com/talentpierre/KivyLightningATM_Repo/tree/master/LightningATM_Kivy_Separate)s github if you need to learn how to build the actual thing. They have great documentation.
Once you have the hardware setup then clone the code and then download the [DeLight](https://github.com/devaultcrypto/DeLight/releases) client to the atm dir and name the client dir *DeLight*:
> devault-atm-touch/DeLight/delight


Then install the requirements and run app.py
